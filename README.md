little project which test if you have critical not compiler/interpreter based errors in javascript/typescript.
Wrote in Typescript.
To use it you need to have installed typescript and create a output respectively the log method (i removed it for the tests):

- clone the project
- npm install
- tsc
- node ./compiled/index.js
- cat ./compiled/log.json
